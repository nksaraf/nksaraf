### Hi there 👋

I am Nikhil. I am the founder and CTO at Qwerty (@qwertynotes). I am a devtools maniac and continuously try to upgrade the developer experience for my teams. The range of tools I have messed around with in the last few years include: 

* Web-based IDEs for React, backends, etc to make development accessible to non-technical people on my teams
* Infrastructure-as-code tools to making backends easy to manage for front-end devs
* powerful custom React hooks
* Researching using natural language to write code for us...

Have built apps with: React, React Query, Relay, GraphQL, Recoil, Prisma, Hasura, Monaco Editor, NextJS, Framer motion, React router, ....

🔭.  Some of the open source projects I've worked on, or, are in progress:

* [use-monaco](https://github.com/nksaraf/use-monaco) 🗒 : 
	- Simple and powerful React hooks to work with [`monaco-editor`](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)
	- Added plugin API to register custom workers, languages and features very easily
	- No bundler required for making monaco-editor work, everything is lazy loaded and uses web-workers wherever possible 
	- Repo: https://github.com/nksaraf/use-monaco
	- used by https://github.com/steveruizok/state-designer-ide
* [excalidraw-studio](https://github.com/nksaraf/excalidraw-studio) 👨‍🎨 : 
	- Wrapper around [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) with a file-explorer to manage multiple drawings (stored in a database)
	- Automatic collaboration session between different teammates working on the same drawing
	- Built with frontend: React, Chakra UI, backend: Hasura, GraphQL, Postgres 
	- Repo: https://github.com/nksaraf/excalidraw-studio
* [magiql-browser](https://magiql-browser.vercel.app) 🌐 :
	- Chrome like IDE with tabs and panels for exploring and developing multiple GraphQL APIs
	- Web-based, built on React, Recoil, use-monaco (monaco-editor)
	- Demo: https://magiql-browser.vercel.app/
	- Repo: https://github.com/nksaraf/magiql-browser
* [playground](https://github.com/nksaraf/playground) 🎲 : 
	- Nodes-based GUI with plugin support to create computation graphs
	- Working towards using these to define serverless functions as operations and connections between different kinds of data (REST API/ GraphQL/File) sources
	- React, Recoil
	- Demo: https://playground-ivory.vercel.app/
	- Repo: https://github.com/nksaraf/playground
* [vite-next](https://github.com/nksaraf/vite-next) 🧬 :
	- NextJS-like SSR, SSG, Routing behaviour with next gen tooling: vite bundler, suspense, react-router v6 (base of remix)
	- Built on Vite, React, React Query, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Framer motion
	- Very experimental
	- Repo: https://github.com/nksaraf/vite-next
* [magiql](https://github.com/nksaraf/magiql) 🧙‍♀️: 
  - React Query's data fetching primitves + relay-runtime's normalized cache = Easy to use and powerful React GraphQL client
	- Wrapper around the Relay compiler to generate typescript instead of flow types
	- Repo: https://github.com/nksaraf/magiql
	- Docs (incomplete): https://magiql.vercel.app/
